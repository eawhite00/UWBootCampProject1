# UTRIPPIN'
This repository is for our first UW Software Development Boot Camp Project

Planning a trip can be a struggle for many people. Stay organized and prepared with up-to-date weather, Google maps, and Wikipedia information on the destination of your choice using our trip planner application. This project calls upon those three APIs, retrieves the relevant information, and dislays it to the user for their convenience. Simply enter the name of the city, the state, and the number of days spent there and watch as the table dynamically updates. Click on the "get info" to view the destination's weather and Wikipedia information. Click on the "remove" button to delete the row from the table once you are finished.
